# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
> In this project, we will use the [dataset](https://github.com/annaS000/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/resources/charity_data.csv) from Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, a CSV containing over 34,000 organizations funded by Alphabet Soup. Our goal is use the features of this dataset to create a binary classifier that is able to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. To do this we will use Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Tensorflow to clean our data and define our model.
